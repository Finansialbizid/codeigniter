Query Builder Class
###################

CodeIgniter gives you access to a Query Builder class. This pattern 
allows information to be retrieved, inserted, and updated in your 
database with minimal scripting. In some cases only one or two lines
of code are necessary to perform a database action.
CodeIgniter does not require that each database table be its own class
file. It instead provides a more simplified interface.

Beyond simplicity, a major benefit to using the Query Builder features
is that it allows you to create database independent applications, since
the query syntax is generated by each database adapter. It also allows
for safer queries, since the values are escaped automatically by the
system.

.. note:: If you intend to write your own queries you can disable this
	class in your database config file, allowing the core database library
	and adapter to utilize fewer resources.

Method Chaining
***************

Method chaining allows you to simplify your syntax by connecting
multiple functions. Consider this example::

	$query = $this->db->select('title')
			->where('id', $id)
			->limit(10, 20)
			->get('mytable');
