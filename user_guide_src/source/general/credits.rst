CodeIgniter was originally developed by `Rick
Ellis <http://www.ellislab.com/>`_ (CEO of `EllisLab,
Inc. <http://ellislab.com/>`_). The framework was written for
performance in the real world, with many of the class libraries,
helpers, and sub-systems borrowed from the code-base of
`ExpressionEngine <http://www.expressionengine.com/>`_.

In the fall of 2014, CodeIgniter found a new home at BCIT, In Burnaby, BC, Canada.
It is currently developed and maintained as a project of the
'British Columbia Institute of Technology <http://www.bcit.ca/cas/computing/>`_.
Bleeding edge development is spearheaded by the handpicked contributors
of the Reactor Team..
